Adjust the “Create Questionnaire From Template” flow so Company A can review and edit the cloned questionnaire before seeing the vendor link.

Right now, when a user clicks “Use Template / Create Questionnaire” on a template:
	•	A new questionnaire is created from the template
	•	The app immediately redirects to the vendor link / send to vendor page

Change this behavior as follows:

⸻

1) After creating from template, redirect to the builder/config page
When a user is on the Templates page and chooses “Use Template” (or similar) and then clicks Create Questionnaire:
	1.	Still create the new questionnaire from the template as you do now:
	•	is_template = false
	•	all question instances cloned (weights, expected answers, answer_mode, etc.)
	•	all conditional rules cloned and remapped
	2.	Do NOT immediately show the vendor link/share view.
	3.	Instead, redirect to the same builder/config page that is used when:
	•	creating a questionnaire manually, or
	•	editing an existing questionnaire’s questions, weights, expected answers, and rules.

This builder page should:
	•	Show the vendor company name and questionnaire title fields at the top (pre-filled from the “Create from template” form)
	•	Show the full list of questions, weights, expected answers, and any conditional logic
	•	Allow Company A to add/remove questions, tweak config, etc.

⸻

2) Add a clear “Continue to Vendor Link” action from the builder
On the builder/config page for a non-template questionnaire:
	•	Add a primary button such as:
	•	“Get Vendor Link” or “Continue to Share Link”

Behavior:
	•	Clicking that button should take the user to the existing vendor link/share page where they can:
	•	copy the link
	•	send to the vendor
	•	see any existing submission status

⸻

3) Guardrails
	•	Do not change how templates are stored or cloned.
	•	Do not change any logic for:
	•	weights
	•	expected answers
	•	conditional rules
	•	vendor answering
	•	Only change:
	•	the redirect after creating a questionnaire from a template
	•	the presence of the “Get Vendor Link” button on the builder page (if needed)

⸻

4) Acceptance criteria
	•	When Company A clicks “Use Template / Create Questionnaire” on a template:
	•	A questionnaire is created from the template as before.
	•	The app redirects to the builder/config page for that new questionnaire (not the vendor link page).
	•	On that builder/config page, Company A can:
	•	edit questions, weights, expected answers, and rules
	•	then click a button (e.g., “Get Vendor Link”) to go to the vendor link/share page.
	•	Vendor behavior is unchanged.
