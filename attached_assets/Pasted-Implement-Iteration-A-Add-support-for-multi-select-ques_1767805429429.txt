Implement Iteration A: Add support for multi-select questions so vendors can choose one or more options for certain questions.
This iteration only adds multi-select behavior. Do not change scoring, expected-answer comparison logic, or conditional rules yet.

⸻

1) Data model changes

For each question instance inside a questionnaire (NOT the global question bank item):
	•	Add a field answer_mode with possible values:
	•	SINGLE (default; current behavior)
	•	MULTI (new; allows multiple selections)

Behavior:
	•	Existing questions default to SINGLE.
	•	New questions also default to SINGLE unless Company A changes it.

For vendor answers:
	•	If answer_mode == SINGLE:
	•	Keep the existing storage format (string, e.g., “Yes”, “No”, etc.).
	•	If answer_mode == MULTI:
	•	Store the vendor’s answer as a list/array of selected option values (e.g., JSON array of strings like ["12h", "24h"]).

⸻

2) Company A configuration (builder side)

On the Company A questionnaire builder / configuration UI, where questions are listed with weight and expected answer:
	•	Add a control for Answer Type per question:
	•	Label: Answer type
	•	Options:
	•	Single Choice (maps to SINGLE)
	•	Multi-Select (maps to MULTI)
	•	Default selection is Single Choice.

This allows Company A to specify whether a question should be answered with:
	•	a single choice (current behavior), or
	•	multiple choices (new behavior).

⸻

3) Vendor UI changes

On the vendor questionnaire page:
	•	If answer_mode == SINGLE:
	•	Keep the current UI exactly as-is (radio buttons or single-select dropdown).
	•	If answer_mode == MULTI:
	•	Render the options as checkboxes so the vendor can select one or more answers.
	•	Ensure the UX clearly shows they can pick multiple values.

When the vendor submits:
	•	For MULTI, send and store all selected values (e.g., as an array / JSON list).

⸻

4) Company A review & export UI

On the Company A submission review/detail page:
	•	If the question is SINGLE:
	•	Show the answer as it is now (single value).
	•	If the question is MULTI:
	•	Display all selected answers in a readable format (e.g., comma-separated or as small badges).

On exports (PDF/CSV):
	•	If MULTI, export the list of selected answers (e.g., joined as a comma-separated string).

⸻

5) Interaction with expected answers & highlighting (for now)
	•	Do not change existing expected answer comparison logic in this iteration.
	•	It is acceptable if multi-select questions temporarily:
	•	show NO_EXPECTATION_DEFINED, or
	•	are not fully evaluated yet.

We will extend expected answers and the Meets/Does-Not-Meet logic for multi-select questions in a later iteration (multiple expected answers + ANY_OF matching).

⸻

6) Vendor visibility
	•	Do not show weight, expected answers, or evaluation status to vendors.
	•	Vendor view changes ONLY in that some questions now allow multiple selections when answer_mode == MULTI.

⸻

7) Guardrails
	•	Do NOT implement conditional branching/conditional questions in this iteration.
	•	Do NOT implement new scoring, risk calculations, or rollups.
	•	Keep all existing routes and features intact (draft saving, uploads, follow-ups, export, status bar).

⸻

Acceptance criteria
	•	Company A can set the answer type per question to Single Choice or Multi-Select.
	•	Vendors see checkboxes and can select multiple answers when answer_mode == MULTI.
	•	Multi-select answers are stored and visible to Company A on review and export.
	•	Existing single-select behavior remains unchanged.
