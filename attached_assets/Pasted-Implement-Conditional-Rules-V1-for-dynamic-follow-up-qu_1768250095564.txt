Implement Conditional Rules (V1) for dynamic follow-up questions.

Goal:
Allow Company A to configure simple conditional logic such that:
“If the vendor answers X on Question A, then show Question B (a follow-up).”

This iteration:
- Uses actual vendor answers only
- Only supports choice-based questions
- Only supports a single action type: SHOW target question
- Does NOT implement scoring, risk totals, or rules based on expectation yet

-------------------------------------------------
1) Data model

Create a ConditionalRule model or table tied to a questionnaire:

Fields (conceptually):
- id
- questionnaire_id
- trigger_question_id      (the parent question within this questionnaire)
- operator                 (string, default "IN")
- trigger_values           (list/array of strings, e.g., JSON array)
- target_question_id       (the follow-up question within this questionnaire)
- make_required            (boolean, default false)

Notes:
- Rules are defined per questionnaire, not globally in the question bank.
- trigger_values should store the answer option values that should trigger the rule (e.g., ["No"] or ["No","Partial"]).

-------------------------------------------------
2) Company A configuration UI

On the questionnaire builder/configuration screen (where Company A sees the list of selected questions with weights and expected answers), add a new section called “Conditional Logic (Optional)”.

Provide a simple UI to create rules:
- For each rule:
  - Dropdown for “Trigger Question” populated with the questions in this questionnaire that have discrete answer options.
  - Multi-select control or checkboxes for “Trigger Answers”, populated with that question’s valid options (e.g., Yes/No/Partial/N/A or other choice options).
  - Dropdown for “Target Question” populated with the other questions in this questionnaire.
  - Checkbox: “Make follow-up required when shown” (optional).

Basic guardrails:
- Prevent selection of the same question as both trigger_question_id and target_question_id for a single rule.
- It is OK if we don’t fully prevent more complex circular rule scenarios in this iteration.

Provide an “Add Rule” button and list out existing rules with a simple description, e.g.:
“If [Trigger Question] is [No, Partial] then show [Target Question].”

Allow deletion of rules.

-------------------------------------------------
3) Vendor-side behavior

On the vendor questionnaire page:

- When rendering the questionnaire:
  - Load all conditional rules for this questionnaire.
  - Initially evaluate all rules based on any existing answers (or treat as unanswered).
  - Hide any target questions whose rule conditions are not met.
  - Show target questions whose conditions are met.

- Add client-side JavaScript (or equivalent) to listen for changes to trigger questions:
  - When a trigger question’s answer changes:
    - Re-evaluate all rules for that trigger question.
    - If a rule condition is true:
      - Show the target question.
      - If make_required is true, mark the target question as required.
    - If a rule condition is false:
      - Hide the target question.
      - Clear any existing answer value(s) for that target question.
      - Remove “required” enforcement for that target question.

Condition evaluation logic:

- For answer_mode == SINGLE:
  - Let answer be the selected option value (string).
  - Condition is true if answer is contained in trigger_values.

- For answer_mode == MULTI:
  - Let answers be the list of selected option values.
  - Condition is true if ANY of the selected answers is contained in trigger_values.

It is acceptable in this iteration to only support rules for questions that have discrete choice options; free-text-only questions can be excluded from the trigger list.

-------------------------------------------------
4) Company A review and export

- On the Company A submission review page, do NOT change existing functionality in this iteration.
- Conditional rules are only about how the questionnaire is presented and which questions vendors see.

-------------------------------------------------
5) Guardrails

- Do NOT implement any new scoring, risk aggregation, or risk labels in this iteration.
- Do NOT implement rules based on evaluation status (Meets / Does Not Meet) yet.
- Keep all existing features working (weights, expected answers, highlighting, uploads, exports, follow-ups, etc.).

-------------------------------------------------
Acceptance criteria

- Company A can define one or more conditional rules per questionnaire.
- Vendor questionnaire dynamically shows/hides target questions based on the configured rules and the vendor’s answers.
- Multi-select questions work as triggers by checking if any selected answer is in trigger_values.
- Hidden follow-up questions are not required and have their answers cleared when hidden.
- Vendor UX remains stable and predictable.
